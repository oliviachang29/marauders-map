			<p>Go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07F6X965Q?ie=UTF8&ref-suffix=ss_rw">Alexa link</a> and click "Enable Skill".</p>

		<div class="text-block">
			<h4>Is there questions from the movies or the extended universe (can we call it that now?)?</h4>
			<p>As Potter purists, we tend to focus on book-only questions. You moviegoers might want to brush up a bit on your facts.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text-block">
			<h4>How does one pronounce "marauder"?</h4>
			<p>Marauder is pronounced "muh-raw-durr".</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md">
		<div class="text-block">
			<h4>Is it really <i>that</i> difficult?</h4>
			<p>Yes. It's hard. Very hard. You have been warned.</p>
			<p>I mean, if you know how off the top of your head under which Kingâ€™s court did Nearly Headless Nick served, it <i>might</i> be only moderately difficult...</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text-block">
			<h4>Is this just going to be like one of those impossible-but-not-really quizzes?</h4>
			<p>No. I promise that this is really, truly, absolutely mind-boggingly difficult. If you've taken "impossible" Harry Potter quizzes before and got all the answers right, then you're probably in the ballpark for getting at least 4 of the 7 questions correct. </p>
