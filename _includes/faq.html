			<h4>Are there questions from the movies/Fantastic Beasts/Cursed Child?</h4>

			<h4>Is it really <i>that</i> difficult?</h4>
			<p>Yes. It's hard. Very hard. You have been warned.</p>

			<h4>Is this just going to be like one of those impossible-but-not-really quizzes?</h4>
			<p>No. I promise that this is really, truly, absolutely mind-boggingly difficult. If you've taken "impossible" Harry Potter quizzes before and got all the answers right, then you're probably in the ballpark for getting at least 4 of the 7 questions correct. </p>
